Flask Application Tutorial

A simple Flask project from youtube channel 'Traversy Media'.

I am following the youtube tutorial 'Python Flask From Scratch' from 'Traversy Media'

( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbbPz6GSEM9hLQObuQjNoj_ )

* The Application is build with Python and Flask and  contains 3 pages: home, about, articles.
* It supports a register page, a login page and is using python's sqlite3 as database (the tutorial implements SQL database).
* Every action that includes register, login and logout is supported by integrated flash messages.
